# 3d Thingy

This is my experiment with creating a 3d game-engine-like-thingy using SDL 2.

![here it is running](screenshot.png)

You can use arrow keys to move around, or fly and land with `w` and `s` keys.


## Compiling

Install dependencies:

    $ sudo apt install gcc make pkg-config libsdl2-dev

I have no idea what you need to do if you don't have apt.

Next you can clone the repo, `cd` into it and compile:

    $ make
    $ ./hello

Run it:

    $ ./3dthingy
